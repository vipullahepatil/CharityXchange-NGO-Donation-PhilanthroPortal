            <p>
              In India, we often see NGOs and donors working in silos lacking a
              common standardized platform to handle end-to-end donation
              processes. CharityXchange aims to address this critical issue by
              bridging this gap between donors and recipients. In this system,
              donors will be assisted throughout the donation decision-making
              process. Verified recipients’ demands will be fulfilled swiftly
              through volunteers. This platform promises to bring credibility
              and efficiency in the existing system.

                  The CharityXchange is a volunteer-based, zero-funds
                  organization that works to get surplus food, stationary,
                  clothes from society and the community to serve them to the
                  less fortunate people.
